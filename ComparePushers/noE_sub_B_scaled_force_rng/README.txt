We run the usual weibel , box size = 40

Lets keep solver off

We use option 
enforce_rng_constancy, logical, default = .true.
So I can run gcaCorr with 1 core and compare with runs with 8 cores

E fields are set to 0 to test curvature drift

scale B 
Subtract B1 so gradB/B is greater and B average~0
