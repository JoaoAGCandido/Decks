We run the usual weibel instability but increase the size of the box so the EM fluctuaitions (L) are must larger than the step of the gca particle update

Lets keep solver off

We use option 
enforce_rng_constancy, logical, default = .true.
So I can run gcaCorr with 1 core and compare with runs with 8 cores
